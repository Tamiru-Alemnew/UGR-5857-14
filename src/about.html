                  I completed the renowned CS50 course from Harvard University,
                  an intensive program designed to introduce the fundamentals of
                  computer science and programming.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The course provided a comprehensive understanding of
                  algorithmic thinking, enabling me to solve complex problems
                  efficiently.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It also delved into the intricacies of data structures,
                  teaching me how to organize and store data effectively for
                  optimal performance.

                <div class="tab-hidden">
                  <li>
                    The course covered web development extensively. I learned to
                    build dynamic websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                    gaining a solid understanding of how the web works.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I learned to write semantic HTML, create responsive and
                    visually appealing layouts with CSS, and add interactivity
                    to websites with JavaScript.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The course introduced me to programming languages like C and
                    Python. I learned to write efficient and readable code in C,
                    understanding the low-level workings of computers. Python
                    was used to teach higher-level concepts like web scraping,
                    data analysis, and machine learning.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The problem-solving skills I acquired from this course are
                    invaluable. I learned to break down complex problems into
                    smaller, manageable parts, and to think algorithmically to
                    come up with efficient solutions.

                  I completed a comprehensive course from FreeCodeCamp, an
                  online platform that offers hands-on and interactive learning
                  experiences. The course was focused on full-stack JavaScript
                  development, covering a wide range of topics and technologies
                  that are essential in today's web development industry.

                <li>
                  The course provided an in-depth understanding of Node.js,
                  Express.js, and MongoDB. Node.js is a runtime environment that
                  allows JavaScript to be run on the server side. Express.js is
                  a web application framework for Node.js, which simplifies the
                  process of building web applications. MongoDB is a NoSQL
                  database that provides high performance, high availability,
                  and easy scalability.

                    I learned how to build robust and scalable APIs using
                    Node.js and Express.js. APIs, or Application Programming
                    Interfaces, are a set of rules and protocols for building
                    and interacting with software applications. They are
                    essential for modern web applications as they allow
                    different software applications to communicate with each
                    other.

                  <li>
                    The course also taught me how to work with different types
                    of databases, including both SQL and NoSQL databases. I
                    learned how to design database schemas, perform CRUD
                    operations, and use advanced querying techniques. This
                    knowledge has equipped me with the skills to choose the
                    right database for different applications and use it
                    effectively.

                  <li>
                    Through this course, I acquired important skills such as
                    back-end development, database management, and server-side
                    scripting. Back-end development involves creating the
                    server-side logic of a web application, which includes
                    interacting with databases, authenticating users, and
                    handling business logic. Database management involves
                    designing, implementing, and maintaining databases.
                    Server-side scripting involves writing scripts that run on
                    the server and generate dynamic web content.

                  <li>
                    Overall, the FreeCodeCamp course provided me with a
                    comprehensive understanding of full-stack JavaScript
                    development. I learned how to build complete web
                    applications, from creating interactive user interfaces on
                    the client side to implementing server-side logic and
                    managing databases. This course has equipped me with the
                    skills and knowledge to become a competent full-stack
                    JavaScript developer.
