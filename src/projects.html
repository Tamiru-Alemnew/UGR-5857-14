            <h3>4K Labs Website</h3>
            <p>
              I built a comprehensive website for 4K Labs, a prominent research
              lab located within the 4 Kilo campus of Addis Ababa University.
              The website serves as a digital platform for the lab to showcase
              its cutting-edge research, highlight the team's expertise, and
              engage with the global scientific community.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project involved a deep understanding of the lab's needs and
              translating them into a functional and aesthetically pleasing
              design. I used modern web technologies to ensure the website is
              responsive, accessible, and SEO-friendly. The website features
              include a dynamic news section, a detailed research section, and a
              contact form for inquiries.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project not only improved my technical skills but also honed
              my ability to communicate and collaborate with clients to deliver
              a product that meets their expectations.

            <h3>Official Apple Website Clone</h3>
            <p>
              As a part of my self-directed learning in web development, I
              undertook the challenge of cloning the official Apple website.
              This project was an intensive study in understanding and
              replicating the intricate design, layout techniques, and user
              experience of a professional, high-traffic website.
            </p>
            <p>
              The website clone was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with
              a keen focus on responsive design to ensure a seamless user
              experience across different device sizes. I implemented various
              features of the original website, such as the footer__navigation
              bar, product sections, and footer links.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project was a great exercise in attention to detail, and it
              significantly improved my understanding of how large-scale
              websites are designed and developed. It also honed my skills in
              debugging and problem-solving as I worked to replicate the
              functionalities of the original website as closely as possible.

            <h3>Official Amazon Website Clone</h3>
            <p>
              One of my most challenging projects was cloning the official
              Amazon website. This project required a deep understanding of
              complex web functionalities such as user authentication, product
              search, shopping cart management, and checkout process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The clone was built using React for the front-end and Node.js with
              Express.js for the back-end. I implemented various features of the
              original website, including user registration and login, product
              listing, shopping cart, and a simulated checkout process.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project was a significant learning experience. It pushed me
              to solve complex problems and implement functionalities that are
              critical to e-commerce websites. It also improved my understanding
              of how large-scale websites handle data and manage user
              interactions.
